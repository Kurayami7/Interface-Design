                Last night, all I think about is you<br>
                Don't stop, baby, you can walk through<br>
                Don't want, baby, think about you<br>
                You know that I'm never gonna lose<br>
                Road shimmer wigglin' the vision<br>
                Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror<br>

                Sometimes, all I think about is you<br>
                Late nights in the middle of June<br>
                Heat waves been fakin' me out<br>
                Can't make you happier now<br>

                <em>[Verse 1]</em><br>
                Usually I put somethin' on TV<br>
                So we never think about you and me<br>
                But today I see our reflections clearly<br>
                In Hollywood, layin' on the screen<br>
                You just need a better life than this<br>
                You need somethin' I can never give<br>
                Fake water all across the road<br>
                It's gone now, the night has come, but<br>

                <em>[Verse 2]</em> <br>
                You can't fight it, you can't breathe<br>
                You say somethin' so lovin', but<br>
                Now I gotta let you go<br>
                You'll be better off in someone new<br>
                I don't wanna be alone<br>
                You know it hurts me too<br>
                You look so broken when you cry<br>
                One more and then I'll say goodbye<br>

                I just wonder what you're dreamin' of<br>
                When you sleep and smile so comfortable<br>
                I just wish that I could give you that<br>
                That look that's perfectly un-sad<br>
