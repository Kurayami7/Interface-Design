# Interface-Design
Designs including a user persona and a wireframe. Includes two front-end projects: Heat Waves Lyrics Website and another to promote the popular chocolate, Kinder Bueno.

The persona and wireframe were created using figma. Please find the previews attached as "User Persona.PNG", and "Wireframe.png" respectively. 

The .fig file is specifically for figma enthusiasts.

Note that I have added another folder called Heat Waves Lyrics Website, which is a website to replicate the lyrics of the popular song, Heat Waves - Glass Animals.
